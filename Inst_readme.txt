Stock Trader - Bullish Cross
Programming challenge description:
A classic stock trading pattern happens when a 9-Day Moving Average (9-DMA) crosses the 50-Day Moving Average (50-DMA). This can be indicative of a bullish or a bearish setup, depending on the direction.

When the 9-DMA crosses above the 50-DMA from below, it is Bullish. When the 9-DMA cross below the 50-DMA from above, it is Bearish.

Write a program that reads in a series of dates and prices, calculates the 9-DMA and 50-DMA, then returns the dates of any bullish signals that occurred.

NOTE: The Moving Average cannot be calculated for a given day if there is not enough historical data to cover the period in question. For example, a series of prices that begin on January 1 cannot have a 9-DMA calculated before January 9 since 9 days of historical prices do not exist until January 9.

Input:
A series of Date|Price pairs in non-localized format. Dates will follow ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DD. Prices will be a two-decimal value with no currency indications.

For example:

2016-01-01|22.05
2016-01-02|22.45
2016-01-03|23.57
